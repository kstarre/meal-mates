# meal-mates

Meal-Mates is a small-scale, food-sharing, social-networking, mobile focused app designed to bring groups of people together for dining convenience.  Currently, the focus is on creating groups at work spaces, but future development hopefully will expand to areas where there are large concentrations of people, such as apartment/condo complexes and university areas.

Our app brings convenience to meal planning for busy people.  Members can join clubs which then alternate food preparation for different days of the work week. Clubs will be limited to seven members or less. By limiting members per group, members can more easily be held accountable for meeting their duties. Users can select their available days for their group, then a schedule is created for upcoming meal preparation.  The schedule can be altered to account for unforeseen events. 

### Processes used to create this program include the following:
